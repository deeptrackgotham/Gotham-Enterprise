# 🎉 MongoDB Integration Complete - Quick Reference

## What You Have Now

Your Gotham-Enterprise app now has **full MongoDB integration** with:

✅ **Database Connection** - Mongoose with connection pooling  
✅ **User Sync** - Automatic sync from Clerk  
✅ **Scan Storage** - All verification results in MongoDB  
✅ **Credit System** - Track and manage user credits  
✅ **API Endpoints** - RESTful routes for all operations  
✅ **Real Frontend** - Dashboard, history, results all use live data  

---

## 🚀 To Get Started (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Get Your MongoDB Connection String

**From MongoDB Atlas (Cloud):**
1. Visit https://mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
2. Create account → Create cluster (free)
3. Click "Connect" → "Connect Your Application"
4. Copy the connection string

**From Local MongoDB:**
```
mongodb://localhost:27017/gotham-enterprise
```

### Step 2: Create `.env.local`

In your project root, create `.env.local`:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/gotham-enterprise?retryWrites=true&w=majority

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret
```

### Step 3: Run the Project

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## 🔗 API Endpoints

| Method | Path | What It Does |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/users/sync` | Create/update user in MongoDB |
| GET | `/api/users/sync` | Get current user info |
| POST | `/api/scans` | Create new scan (1 credit) |
| GET | `/api/scans` | Get all user scans |
| GET | `/api/results/[id]` | Get scan details |
| DELETE | `/api/results/[id]` | Delete a scan |

## 📊 Data Schema

### Users Table
```
- clerkId (unique)
- email
- fullName
- imageUrl
- credits (starts at 5)
- plan (trial, starter, growth, enterprise)
- timestamps
```

### Scans Table
```
- scanId (unique)
- userId
- fileName
- fileType (image, video, audio)
- status (AUTHENTIC, SUSPICIOUS, DEEPFAKE)
- confidenceScore (0-100)
- modelsUsed (array)
- imageUrl
- description
- features (array)
- timestamps
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### On User Login:
```
1. Clerk authenticates user
2. UserSyncProvider detects login
3. Automatically calls POST /api/users/sync
4. User saved to MongoDB with 5 credits
```

### On File Upload:
```
1. User selects file
2. handleFileUpload() called
3. Calls POST /api/scans with file info
4. Server deducts 1 credit
5. Scan saved to MongoDB
6. Redirects to results page
```

### On View History:
```
1. Page loads
2. useEffect calls fetchScans()
3. GET /api/scans fetches from MongoDB
4. Displays all user scans
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Fixes

### Error: "Cannot find MONGODB_URI"
**Fix:** Add to `.env.local`:
```env
MONGODB_URI=your_connection_string
```
Then restart dev server.

### Error: "Unauthorized" on API calls
**Fix:** Make sure you're logged in with Clerk. Check Clerk keys in `.env.local`.

### Error: 402 "Insufficient credits"
**Fix:** This happens when user has 0 credits. Upgrade plan or purchase credits.

### Scans not showing in history
**Fix:** 
1. Make sure MongoDB connection is working
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify user is logged in

### TypeScript errors about user-sync-provider
**Fix:** Restart dev server with `npm run dev`

## 🔐 Security Notes

✅ All endpoints require Clerk authentication  
✅ Users can only access their own data  
✅ Passwords NOT stored (Clerk handles auth)  
✅ Server validates all requests  
✅ Credits checked before operations

## 🎁 What's Next?

### You Can Now:
- ✅ Users sign up and get stored in MongoDB
- ✅ Track scan history for each user
- ✅ Show real credit balances
- ✅ Display real scan results
- ✅ Manage user data

### Still Need To:
- [ ] Connect to actual verification service
- [ ] Upload files to storage (S3, Cloudinary)
- [ ] Send files for actual AI verification
- [ ] Handle webhooks from verification service
- [ ] Add pagination to history
- [ ] Export results as PDF
- [ ] Email notifications
