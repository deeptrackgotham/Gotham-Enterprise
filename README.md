```env
MONGODB_URI=
gotham-enterprise
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret
```

2. **Install and run:**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. **Visit http://localhost:3000**

See `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` or `QUICKSTART.md` for detailed setup.

## Database (MongoDB)

This project uses **MongoDB** for data persistence:

### Collections:
- **users** - Clerk-synced user data with credit tracking
- **verificationresults** - Scan results and verification history

### Features:
- ✅ Automatic user sync from Clerk
- ✅ Credit system (5 initial credits per user)
- ✅ Plan management (trial, starter, growth, enterprise)
- ✅ Full scan history with timestamps
- ✅ Indexed queries for performance

### Setup:
1. Create MongoDB project (free at https://mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Get connection string
3. Add to `.env.local` as `MONGODB_URI`

See `MONGODB_SETUP.md` for complete database guide.

## Authentication (Clerk)

Gotham-Enterprise uses **Clerk** for:  
- Sign-in / Sign-up  
- Session management  
- User profile access  
- Route protection  


### Clerk Integration Overview

- `ClerkProvider` is wrapped around the entire application in `layout.tsx`.
- Middleware is configured to protect authenticated routes such as:
  - `/dashboard`
  - `/history`
  - `/verify`
- Components use:
  - `useUser()` to access user data.
  - `useAuth()` to access tokens/session.
  - Clerk UI components like `<SignIn />`, `<SignUp />`, `<UserButton />`.

### Required Clerk Environment Variables

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_key


---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+  
- npm, yarn, or pnpm  
- Clerk account (for authentication keys)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deeptrackgotham/Gotham-Enterprise.git

### Environment Variables
